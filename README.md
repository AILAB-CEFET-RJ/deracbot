# Botderac

The DeracBot Project is a chatbot developed to assist students of CEFET-RJ (Maracan√£ Campus) in registering exemption requests for courses. The chatbot is integrated with various components and resources, including Node.js, Google Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Firestore, Google DialogFlow ES, and the Facebook infrastructure.

## Java environment

Ensure you have Java version 11 or greater installed on the hosting maching.

## Node.js environment

In order to ensure that the correct dependencies are installed, one MAY chose to run the following [commands](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started?hl=pt-br) inside the project's root directory:

Bash

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init firestore
firebase init functions
cd functions
npm uninstall --save-dev firebase-functions-test
npm install --save-dev actions-on-google
npm install
```

**Note for command 2**: login using the same Google account in wich the project was created.

**Note for commands 3 and 4**: avoid overriding repository **FILES** while configuring a new step up.

**Optional**: check the installation. The following commands should print node version v18.16.0 or greater and npm version 9.5.1 or greater:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

[Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases) are some Node.js + NPM pair version.

## Running

To start all, build the scrip, then run the emulators:

Bash

```bash
cd functions
npm run build
cd ..
firebase emulators:start
```

**Note**: you may need to run the last command again if the Google Cloud Function's Emulator fails to load the function in the local environment.
